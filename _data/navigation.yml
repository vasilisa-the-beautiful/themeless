# In the navigation _includes file we loop through using site.data.navigation as defined here.
# These are just page paths, not validated.
#
# Alternatively, loop through the front matter of pages and use header_pages value in config
# file reference the filenames of nav items, in required ordered. That should look up the page
# from all the pages. Also, then titles from the page can be used, rather than setting here.
